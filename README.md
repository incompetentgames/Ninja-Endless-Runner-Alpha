# 🥷 One-Button Ninja

**One-Button Ninja** is a fast-paced endless runner built in **Unity (WebGL)**.  
Players master timing with just three actions — **jump**, **slide**, and **attack** — while racing across rooftops, dodging traps, and slashing through enemies.  

The game started as a **6-hour/week solo project** and reached a complete **MVP stage**. This repo now hosts the **Alpha Production** codebase and builds leading up to a polished release.
